Java framework for binary structured logs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0.1 - 2012-09-13
  * Fixed more dependencies.

2.0.0 - 2012-09-06
  * Fixed dependencies and build.

1.4.0 - 2011-09-25
  * Added "seek forward" feature to BinlogFileReader - allows simple skipping of
    records in a binlog.  Useful for many purposes: e.g. resuming the processing
    of a binlog where one needs to start in the middle of a binlog rather than
    the beginning.
  * Added "server-id" property to BinlogFileHeader to simply setting/getting of
    this optional parameter -- which is now nearly a required parameter for many
    applications that use this library.

1.3.1 - 2011-09-05
  * Faster performance with reading GZip compressed files by using a 1MB 
    buffered inputstream.

1.3.0 - 2011-08-23
  * Added support for creating a BinlogFileReader from an InputStream.
  * Added support for automatically detecting a compressed file by its filename
    suffix and reading it. 

1.2.0 - 2011-08-18
  * Added new FileRotatePeriods of TEN_MINUTES, QUARTER_HOUR, and HALF_HOUR.

1.1.0 - 2009-08-18
  * Added support for an "active" binlog file that contains the filename of the
    active binlog file.  If enabled, the file is stored in the same directory
    as the binlogs with the format [name].active (enabled by default).
  * Added support for a maxClosedBinlogSize binlogger configuration setting to
    only keep the last X number of closed binlogs in-memory.  By default, this
    is set to 10.

1.0.0 - 2008-08-14
  * Initial Release
